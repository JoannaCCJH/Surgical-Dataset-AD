################ Reconstruction ##############
directory_dir: "/home/joanna/Desktop/data/anomaly_detection/val/P10_7566_8105" # The directory where the images are stored.
output_dir: "./output" # The directory where the output will be saved.

model_dir: "./checkpoints" # The directory where the model is stored.
model: "model_all_with_tools.pth" # The model name.

batch_size: 64 # The batch size for the dataloader.
downsample: 1 # The downsample factor for the images. (1: no downsample, 2: downsample by 2, 4: downsample by 4, etc.)

save_image: False # Save the reconstructed images.

############### Compute Threshold ################
use_kurtosis: True # Use the kurtosis to determine if the distribution is unimodal or not. If the distribution is unimodal, all images will be classified as normal.
kurtosis_threshold: 0.5   # The threshold for the kurtosis. If you find the model misclassify the distribution as unimodal, you can lower this threshold
